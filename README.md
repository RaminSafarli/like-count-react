This is a simple React component that allows users to increment or decrement a "like" counter, or reset the counter to zero. The component consists of three buttons: "Like", "Dislike", and "Reset". The component uses the `useState` hook from React to manage the state of the counter, and the `switch` statement to determine which operation to perform when a button is clicked.

## Installation

To use this component in your project, you will need to have [React](https://reactjs.org/) installed. Then, you can install the component using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install like-button
```
